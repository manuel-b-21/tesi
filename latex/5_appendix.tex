\chapter{Chaos analysis for oscilloscope quantization}\label{app: quantization}

The following plots represent the chaotic behavior of the system of four coupled blocks,
in which the oscilloscope quantization is progressively increased
(see Section~\ref{sec: oscilloscope quantization}).
For these analyses the driving voltage $V_d$ is always set to 0.05 V, and the number of points
in the sampled sequences is always $2\times 10^5$.

\chapter{Chaos analysis on multiple coupled blocks}\label{app: multiple blocks}

The following plots represent the chaotic behavior of the system from 5 to 25 coupled blocks
(excluding 13 since it is presented in Section~\ref{sec: many blocks chaos}),
using the signal $W_1$ as the time series.
When the number of blocks is odd, an additional analysis was carried out on the signal $W_k$, where
the $k$-th block is located in the center (e.g.\ in the seven blocks case,
the analyzed signal will be $W_4$).
For these analyses the driving voltage $V_d$ is always set to 0.05 V, and the number of points
in the sampled sequences is always $2\times 10^5$.
