Project for my master thesis.

The actual thesis is the 'main.pdf' file located in the 'latex' folder.

The coding has been done in the 'blocks' folder, in which essentially the same procedure has been carried out in the several 'n_blocks' folder.

An example of the coding can be seen in the folder '6_blocks/2e5_points/data_chaos'; I wrote the '.gp' and '.py' files for data analysis and visualization,
while I only made some modifications in the '.sh' scripts which perform the calculations.
